<p><span class="smcap">The</span> three lectures on Turkey are
published at the request of several of my parishioners; I have
added two others respecting Rome, which were written in 1873,
because I consider that they strengthen the conclusion derived
from the present position of the Ottoman Empire.&nbsp; I regard
Rome and Turkey as two great political witnesses to the near
approach of the glorious end.&nbsp; If this be the case, it is
clearly right that their two testimonies should appear together
and confirm each other.</p>

<h3>I.<br />
THE OUTLINE.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">It</span> is impossible to imagine
anything more delightful than the prospect of the promised return
of our most blessed Saviour.&nbsp; How do the father and the
mother feel when they welcome their long-absent son from
India?&nbsp; How will many an English wife feel when she welcomes
her husband from the Arctic Expedition?&nbsp; And how must the
Church of God feel when, after her long night of toil and
difficulty, she stands face to face before Him whom her soul
loveth, and enters into <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>the full enjoyment of the promise,
&lsquo;So shall we ever be with the Lord.&rsquo;&nbsp; There will
be no tears then, for there will be no sorrow; no death then, for
there will be no more curse; no sin then, for we shall see Him as
He is, and shall be like Him.&nbsp; Then will be the time of
resurrection, when all the firstborn of God shall awake to a life
without decay and without corruption; and then the time of
reunion, when the whole company of God&rsquo;s elect shall stand
together before the Lord, never again to shed a tear over each
other&rsquo;s grave; and then will be the time when those who
have loved and longed after Him, as they have journeyed on alone
in their pilgrimage, will find themselves on the right hand of
His throne, and hear His delightful words, &lsquo;Come, ye
blessed children of my Father: inherit the kingdom <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>prepared for
you from the foundation of the world!&rsquo;</p>
<p>No wonder then that the people of God are waiting with anxious
hearts for the advent; and no wonder that many are ready to say,
&lsquo;Lord, how long?&rsquo; and to ask, What hope is there of
His quick return?&nbsp; Have we, or have we not, any reason to
look out for it soon?&nbsp; To this inquiry I would endeavour to
draw your attention this morning; and in doing so, I do not
intend to examine into what are usually called &lsquo;the signs
of the times,&rsquo; but to study the great prophetic sketch of
the world&rsquo;s history as given to us by the prophet
Daniel.&nbsp; This may be termed the backbone of prophecy, and
almost all the great prophecies of Holy Scripture fit into it at
some point or other; so that, if we wish to understand them, we
must begin by <a name="page4"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
4</span>studying it.&nbsp; I fear I may not interest those who
aim simply to have their hearts warmed by the ministry.&nbsp; But
they must remember that the real study of God&rsquo;s Word
requires work, and that work, though it lays the best possible
foundation for feeling, does not at the time excite it.&nbsp;
To-day, then, we are to work, and I hope the Lord may so bless
His Word, that through work we may be led to feel.</p>
<p>Our business, then, is to endeavour to discover whether the
great prophetic sketch of history, given through the prophet
Daniel, encourages the blessed hope that the coming of the Lord
may be near.&nbsp; Daniel gives a prophecy of the history of
political power from his own day till the time when &lsquo;the
Ancient of Days shall sit,&rsquo; and describes a succession of
events which must take place in the <a name="page5"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 5</span>interval.&nbsp; It is clear that our
business is to ascertain how many of these events have taken
place, or, in other words, how far we have advanced in the
series.</p>
<p>In the study of our subject we have the advantage of looking
at two sides of the picture, for it has pleased God to give us
the same series as seen in two different aspects.&nbsp; In the
second and seventh chapters you will find predictions of the same
events under different figures.&nbsp; In the second chapter the
prophecy is given as a vision to a proud, idolatrous
monarch.&nbsp; So the different kingdoms about to arise appear to
him as the several parts of a mighty image, with himself as the
head of gold.&nbsp; It was given in just such a shape as should
coincide with his idolatry and his pride.&nbsp; Whereas, in the
seventh chapter, the vision is given to one of God&rsquo;s
people, and he sees <a name="page6"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
6</span>in all this glory nothing better than a series of wild
beasts coming up one after another to devour.&nbsp; How different
is the estimate of the world from that of God!&nbsp; The world
regards Babylon as the head of gold, the summit of glory and
greatness, while God looks on it as a savage beast, to be dreaded
by His saints!&nbsp; The same difference of character may be
observed in the visions of the coming of the Lord.&nbsp; To the
great king it appeared as a triumphant kingdom, to the captive
prophet as a manifestation of the Son of man.&nbsp; The one saw a
kingdom, the other a person; the one, the overthrow of power, the
other, the advent of the Lord of Glory.</p>
<p>But now let us look at the series.&nbsp; In both prophecies
there is a description of four kingdoms which should in
succession be supreme in political power, and which <a
name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>should fill up
an interval between Daniel and the Advent.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; There is the head of gold in Nebuchadnezzar&rsquo;s
image, the same as the lion in the vision of Daniel.&nbsp; The
most precious of metals corresponding to the king of beasts.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; There is next the breast and arms of silver,
corresponding to the bear of Daniel.</p>
<p>3.&nbsp; After that the belly and thighs of brass,
representing the same nation as the leopard of the prophet.</p>
<p>4.&nbsp; And following them is the last kingdom of the four,
represented to Nebuchadnezzar as the &lsquo;legs of iron, and the
feet, part of iron and part of clay,&rsquo; and to Daniel as a
beast, &lsquo;dreadful and terrible, and strong
exceedingly.&rsquo;</p>
<p>It is interesting to observe how the same iron character is
attributed to this <a name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
8</span>last power in both visions.&nbsp; In the one we read of
it, chap. ii. 40, &lsquo;The fourth kingdom shall be strong as
iron: forasmuch as iron breaketh in pieces and subdueth all
things; and as iron that breaketh all things, shall it break in
pieces and bruise.&rsquo;&nbsp; And in the other, chap. vii. 7,
it is said to be, &lsquo;strong exceedingly, and it had great
iron teeth: it devoured, and brake in pieces, and stamped the
residue with the feet of it.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Such is the series of kingdoms that were to hold the chief
political power of the world, and fill up the whole interval
between the date of the prophecy and the advent of the
Lord.&nbsp; Now the remarkable, and I believe I may say the
indisputable, fact, is that, according to the prophecy, all these
four kingdoms have arisen.&nbsp; They have followed each other
exactly as it was predicted.&nbsp; Babylon <a
name="page9"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 9</span>was the head of
gold, or the lion.&nbsp; The Medes and Persians were the breast
of silver, or the bear.&nbsp; Greece, always called &lsquo;the
brazen armed,&rsquo; in classic poetry, was the belly and the
thighs of brass, or the leopard.&nbsp; And then the mighty power
of Rome, far exceeding all the others in its terrible strength,
with the legs of iron in the royal image, and the teeth of iron
in the prophetic beast.&nbsp; Thus far there is an agreement
almost unanimous among the students of prophetic Scripture; and
the conclusion certainly is, that we have already been a long
time under the last of the four successive empires of the
world.&nbsp; So far then as those four empires are concerned, we
are encouraged to entertain the strong hope that, as we have
reached the last kingdom in the succession, we may begin
hopefully to <a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>look out for the end.&nbsp; We have passed the last
station on the line, so now we may begin to prepare for home.</p>
<p>But again.&nbsp; There is one remarkable difference between
the fourth kingdom and the other three, viz., this, that its
history is divided into two periods, during the first of which it
appears as an undivided power, and during the second split up
into ten.&nbsp; In chap, ii. 41, it says, &lsquo;the kingdom
shall be divided.&rsquo;&nbsp; In this divided period it is
represented by the ten toes on the image, and the ten horns on
the beast.&nbsp; The ten toes are described as kings, or
kingdoms, in chap. ii. 44; and so are the ten horns in chap. vii.
24, where it is said, &lsquo;The ten horns out of this kingdom
are ten kings that shall arise.&rsquo;&nbsp; So then the prophecy
teaches us that when Rome had overpowered Greece it would go on
for a time as one mighty <a name="page11"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 11</span>undivided empire, but that after a
time it would break up into a cluster of kingdoms, and that this
cluster would retain amongst them the supremacy of the
world.&nbsp; It does not describe any fresh shift of political
supremacy to any new kingdom that should arise, or the loss or
decay of that supremacy.&nbsp; But it teaches that there would be
a division in the kingdom, that the parts should fall asunder,
and that, while the iron of the fourth kingdom would remain
amongst them, there should be so much clay mixed up with it, that
it should never again be united under a single head.</p>
<p>Now this is exactly what has happened.&nbsp; In the days of
the C&aelig;sars united Rome was supreme in the pomp of the iron
empire.&nbsp; Its body was Europe, and its heart was the
emperor.&nbsp; It was one as much as Babylon had been one under
<a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>Nebuchadnezzar.&nbsp; But look at it now.&nbsp; There is
all the old power; for Europe and its races practically govern
the world.&nbsp; It has not lost its iron.&nbsp; But there is no
one kingdom that embodies all.&nbsp; The power is vested in a
cluster of independent nations.&nbsp; Many attempts have been
made to combine them: some by conquest, as in the case of
Napoleon; some by negotiation, as in the case of the Spanish
marriages.&nbsp; But all in vain, for the toes are irrecoverably
divided, and whatever is done, though as an aggregate they retain
their power, as individual nations they are always
distinct.&nbsp; I have no time to enter into detail, but I regard
this division as a most remarkable fulfilment of the prophetic
word.&nbsp; More than five hundred years before the coming of the
Lord there was a captive in Babylon, and God so directed <a
name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>that
man&rsquo;s mind, as through him to communicate to the world even
then the present position of modern Europe.&nbsp; With such a
fact before us who can doubt the inspiration of the prophet, or
the statement of St. Peter, that &lsquo;holy men of God spake as
they were moved by the Holy Ghost?&rsquo;</p>
<p>But, without stopping to consider the wonders of the prophecy,
let us learn the lesson which it teaches us with reference to the
nearness of the Advent.&nbsp; We have already found that we have
long since reached the fourth kingdom of the series; and now we
are led a step further, and find that we have long since reached
the second period of that kingdom.&nbsp; It is difficult with
accuracy to assign a date, for the transition was gradual; but we
shall be sufficiently near if we say that it practically took
place between <a name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
14</span>twelve and fourteen hundred years ago.&nbsp; And when we
reflect on such a promise as that in Daniel, ii. 44, in which God
assures us of a kingdom that shall be set up in the days of these
kings, and never be destroyed: when we consider that those kings
have already been reigning through that lengthened period, it is
surely time that we begin to look out for that which is to come;
for the happy and blessed day when we shall welcome the kingdom
which shall never be moved, and when Christ Himself shall reign
in glory.</p>
<p>But this is not all, for, although we shall learn no more from
the vision of the king, we may gather much more from that of the
prophet, for in it we find a most important additional
prophecy.&nbsp; I can perfectly understand why it was given by
the prophet, and not by <a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>the king, for I believe it to refer
to the religious history of Europe, and the king of course had no
concern with that.&nbsp; He did not care for religion, or for the
saints of God.&nbsp; I allude to the prophecy of the little horn
raised in the midst of the other ten.&nbsp; I have no time to
discuss arguments, and can merely state conclusions.&nbsp; All
therefore that I can do now is to express my own convictions on
two points:</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; That the little horn diverse from all the rest is the
Papal power.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; That the time, times, and dividing of a time, which
is to be the limit of its power, stands in prophetic figure for
1260 years.</p>
<p>If this be correct it gives some idea as to the duration of
the second division of the last kingdom, for it shows that it
must last at least 1260 years.&nbsp; Still more, as the <a
name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 16</span>Papacy is to
be destroyed at the approach of the Ancient of Days, if we could
only ascertain the date of its commencement we might calculate
the date of the Advent.&nbsp; But here is the difficulty, for who
can say when a horn begins to grow? and who can determine the
date of the first swelling of Papal pride?&nbsp; It is impossible
to make any such calculation, and I believe it would be wrong to
attempt it.&nbsp; But we may still be led by the great outline to
hope for the approach of that most blessed day.&nbsp; The horn
has been growing a long time, and it is impossible to read
European history without believing that the 1260 years cannot be
very far from its close.&nbsp; Everything therefore looks like an
approaching end.&nbsp; We have long since reached the fourth
kingdom; long since reached its second, or divided period; and,
though we cannot say when <a name="page17"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 17</span>it took place, we have long since
seen the commencement of the 1260 years of the little horn.&nbsp;
Surely then it is high time that we be looking out for the coming
of the Lord, high time that we be watching with our loins girt
and our lamps burning, and we ourselves as those that wait for
their Lord.</p>
<p>With these facts before us, I may fairly ask any thinking
person, whether there is not good ground for the hope that the
coming of the Lord draweth nigh?&nbsp; You observe I have not
dwelt on minute and isolated points.&nbsp; I have taken the great
outline of the world&rsquo;s history, and compared it with the
great outline of the word of prophecy.&nbsp; I see that the two
exactly correspond.&nbsp; I thank God from the bottom of my heart
for the evidence given of the inspiration of Scripture, for no
such prophecy could have had its <a name="page18"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 18</span>origin with man; and, while I thank
God for such a confirmation of the faith, I cannot resist the
conclusion that we have nearly reached the end of the series,
that we are living in the last part of the last period of the
last kingdom, and that the next great event of this prophecy is
nothing else than the sitting of the Ancient of Days, the
glorious kingdom of the Son of Man.</p>
<p>But do we all desire it?&nbsp; Are we all looking out with
loving and longing hearts for the appearance of our beloved
Redeemer?&nbsp; I fear that many would be very far from glad if
they thought it would come to-morrow.&nbsp; Their own consciences
tell them they are not ready; and in such a case how can they
desire it?&nbsp; You might say to them, as in the words of the
prophet, &lsquo;To what end is the day of the Lord to you? the
day of <a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 19</span>the
Lord is darkness and not light.&rsquo;&nbsp; I believe it to be
impossible for any man really to desire the coming of Christ as
his king until in his own soul he is personally acquainted with
Him as his sin-offering or atonement.&nbsp; Thus I believe that
you will find very few really desire the Advent who have not
practically and experimentally drunk in the great doctrine of
justification by faith.&nbsp; If you are reconciled through the
precious blood of Christ; if you are justified in the
righteousness of Christ; if you are preserved and sanctified by
the loving Spirit of Christ, then of course you will be ready to
say, &lsquo;Even so come, Lord Jesus; come quickly.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But if you are still living for the world, content with the
world&rsquo;s gifts and the world&rsquo;s enjoyments; or even if
you are still toiling, and struggling on to reach Him you know
not how, <a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>and know not whether you may trust Him to place you on
the right hand of the throne or not, how is it possible that you
should be happy in waiting for Him?&nbsp; Never rest, therefore,
till you stand accepted in Him; till you have good reason to
believe that you are safe, and not safe only, but beloved.&nbsp;
Then you may wait for Him, then you may welcome Him, then He
cannot come too soon to please you; and if His sign is seen even
to-night you will be able to say, &lsquo;This is our God; we have
waited for Him, and He will save us: this is the Lord; we have
waited for Him, we will be glad and rejoice in His
salvation.&rsquo;</p>
<h3><a name="page21"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 21</span>II.<br
/>
THE CONSUMPTION.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">endeavoured</span> in the last lecture
to bring before you the blessed hope of our Lord&rsquo;s return,
and to show, from the great outlines of prophecy, that there is
enough to justify the expectations of those who humbly trust that
we shall not have much longer to wait.&nbsp; I purposely avoided
any reference to what are called the &lsquo;signs of the
times,&rsquo; and confined your attention exclusively to what may
be called the great backbone of prophecy, <i>i.e.</i>, to the
prophetic history of the four mighty kingdoms which were foretold
as holding the empire of the world.&nbsp; From that outline I
endeavoured to show that these four great kingdoms <a
name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 22</span>were to arise
in succession, one after the other, and that they would fill up
the interval between the time of the prophecy and the sitting of
the Ancient of Days.&nbsp; I hope, also, I made it plain from
history that three of those kingdoms have long since fallen, and
that, as far as the predicted periods enable us to judge, we must
be drawing near to the close of the fourth.&nbsp; The great
outline, therefore, leads to the hope that the time of the
glorious kingdom of our blessed Lord may be near.&nbsp; But,
though we did not study the signs of the times then, I do not
think we should undervalue them, for our blessed Saviour foretold
certain things that should take place, and added, &lsquo;When ye
shall see all these things, know that it is near, even at the
doors.&rsquo;&nbsp; If, therefore, any of these things are now
taking place, it is clear that we ought to study them; and that
<a name="page23"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 23</span>we should
not be really carrying out the teaching of the Lord Jesus if we
were to neglect them.&nbsp; I propose, therefore, in obedience to
His words, to bring before you in this lecture what has long
appeared to me one of the most conclusive signs that the time is
not very far distant.&nbsp; I allude to the present position of
the Church of Rome, and I earnestly hope that God has directed my
thoughts in the study of it, and that whatever in what I may now
say is according to His word, may be written in all our hearts
and minds by the teaching of the Holy Ghost.</p>
<p>There are three great historical prophecies, which, in the
opinion of the majority of our best expositors, predict the rise,
the progress, and the fall of the Church of Rome.</p>
<p>The first of these we briefly noticed <a
name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 24</span>last
Sunday.&nbsp; It is the prophecy of the little horn rising amidst
the ten horns of the beast, or the Papacy rising in the midst of
that cluster of European kingdoms which succeeded the power of
the undivided Roman Empire.</p>
<p>The second is the prophecy of &lsquo;the man of sin&rsquo; in
2 Thess. ii.&nbsp; And I cannot forbear the mention of one
illustration of a verse in that prophecy which I saw myself in
Rome.&nbsp; Many people think that the description in the fourth
verse is too strong for Popery: but there is a curious
illustration of it in St. Peter&rsquo;s.&nbsp; You may there see
what they call the altar in the usual place at the end of the
chancel, and above it, surrounded by an elaborately decorated
reredos, is what is called the chair of St. Peter, or the
Pope&rsquo;s throne, the seat of Papal power.&nbsp; On the altar
below, according to their own teaching, <a
name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 25</span>is the living
person of the King of Glory, perfect man and perfect God, and in
front of that altar may be seen men worshipping the wafer because
they call it God.&nbsp; But above it is the Pope&rsquo;s chair,
and if he were to occupy it he would sit there with that which
they call God, and worship as God, beneath his feet.&nbsp; Can
anything be a more exact fulfilment of the words, &lsquo;Exalteth
himself above all that is called God, or that is
worshipped?&rsquo;</p>
<p>The third is the prophecy of the woman in Rev. xvii.&nbsp; The
application of this to the Church of Rome is less disputed than
that of either of the other two, for the seat of the woman is
decided by the 9th verse to be the seven-hilled city, which is
almost universally admitted to be Rome.</p>
<p>Now it is not my object to study the details of these
prophecies, and there is only one point to which I invite your <a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>careful
attention&mdash;one most important point common to all the three,
viz. that the final overthrow will be preceded by a consuming
process.&nbsp; It will not be a sudden destruction in the height
of prosperity, but will be the final act after a period of
wasting and defeat.&nbsp; If these three passages refer to Rome,
as I fully believe they do, then Rome will be first consumed and
then destroyed.</p>
<p>In Daniel it says (vii. 26), &lsquo;The judgment shall
sit.&rsquo;&nbsp; It seems clear from the context, that this does
not mean the great day of judgment, but the commencement of
judgment on her sins here upon earth.&nbsp; &lsquo;And they shall
take away his dominion to consume and to destroy it unto the
end.&rsquo;&nbsp; There is, therefore, a consuming process before
the end.&nbsp; The word here rendered &lsquo;consume&rsquo;
conveys the idea of a gradual process, and not a sudden blow; <a
name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 27</span>and teaches
us that there will be a wasting before the final overthrow.</p>
<p>In 2 Thess. ii. 8, exactly the same process is described, and
in almost the same words: &lsquo;Whom the Lord shall consume with
the spirit of his mouth, and destroy at the brightness of his
coming.&rsquo;&nbsp; He will first consume him by His word, and
ultimately destroy him at His advent.</p>
<p>It is just the same in Rev. xvii.&nbsp; There you meet with
the old beast, the ten-horned beast of Daniel; and ten horns
still representing ten kings; and when we reach the close of the
chapter we find these ten kings all turned against the woman: so
that, instead of being ridden and governed by her, as they were
when she was riding on the beast, they are now turned against
her, and agree in consuming her.&nbsp; &lsquo;The ten horns which
thou sawest upon the beast, these shall <a
name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 28</span>hate the
whore, and make her desolate and naked, and shall eat her flesh,
and burn her with fire.&rsquo; (Verse 16.)</p>
<p>Without stopping to look into the detail, which it is
impossible to do in a short lecture, it appears clear that all
these passages agree in predicting a period during which the
Papacy will be consumed before its final fall.&nbsp; This will be
brought about partly by the power of truth, and partly by the
change of mind in the kings.&nbsp; But whatever be the agency,
the result is the same.&nbsp; &lsquo;They will take away his
dominion, to consume, and to destroy unto the end.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And this you mark is the last great process before the coming of
our blessed Saviour, for the final destruction will be by the
brightness of His coming.</p>
<p>And now comes the question, Has this consuming process
begun?&nbsp; Is it, or is <a name="page29"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 29</span>it not, in progress?&nbsp; I know
that some fainthearted people will say, &lsquo;Oh, no!&nbsp; Rome
is making dreadful progress, and must soon triumph.&rsquo;&nbsp;
But surely that opinion is contrary to fact.&nbsp; Surely it may
be proved, from the great facts of European history, not merely
that the consumption has begun, but that it has been going on
during the last few years with peculiar and unexampled speed.</p>
<p>Let us look at a few great European facts, not at little
things that happen to fall within our own observation, but at
great facts that are conspicuous before the world.</p>
<p>Rome has always claimed, as she does still, dominion over all
the kingdoms of the world, and she used to exercise it over all
those of Western Christendom.&nbsp; Her claim even went so far
that, by the common consent and advice of his barons, the <a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>King of
England once &lsquo;resigned England and Ireland to God, to St.
Peter and St. Paul, to Pope Innocent, and his successors in the
Apostolic chair: and agreed to hold these dominions as feudatory
of the Church of Rome, by the annual payment of one thousand
marks.&rsquo; <a name="citation30"></a><a href="#footnote30"
class="citation">[30]</a>&nbsp; Imagine any one standing up
amongst the barons of England, and making such a proposal
now!&nbsp; That dominion of the Papacy is taken away, and taken
away, as I believe, for ever.</p>
<p>When the dominion was gone he made concordats, or compacts,
with the different states; in which, with varying conditions, it
was agreed that he should uphold them by his spiritual power, and
they uphold him by the secular arm.&nbsp; It is a most remarkable
fact, that within the last fifteen years almost all of <a
name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 31</span>these
concordats have been brought abruptly to a violent end: those
with Naples, Tuscany, and the Italian Duchies in 1858; that with
Austria, including Venice, in 1866; with Spain in 1868; with
France in 1870; and with Bavaria in 1873.&nbsp; There may be
others remaining in force, but I know of none.&nbsp; According to
the best information I can obtain, all are dissolved.&nbsp; The
Papacy has lost all its political power.&nbsp; The ten kings have
shaken off his government, and there is not one left that submits
to his authority.</p>
<p>But more than that.&nbsp; The Pope of Rome used to be king
over a considerable portion of Italy.&nbsp; But he is now
deposed.&nbsp; The States of the Church are incorporated with
united Italy, and the Pope is king no more.&nbsp; They have taken
away his dominion.&nbsp; His sovereignty <a
name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 32</span>is at an
end.&nbsp; Five years ago it received its death-blow, and shall
we not acknowledge that the consuming process is begun?</p>
<p>But further still.&nbsp; The Church of Rome used to have vast
estates.&nbsp; The convents which used to swarm through Italy
were richly endowed with landed property.&nbsp; But as soon as
the kingdom of Italy was well established, those convents were
broken up and their property confiscated.&nbsp; And now that the
Pope has been dethroned in Rome, a similar measure has been
passed for all those within the city, and on the 20th of October,
1874, they received notice of their dissolution.&nbsp; It looks
very much as if the kings were eating up the flesh of the woman.
<a name="citation32"></a><a href="#footnote32"
class="citation">[32]</a></p>
<p><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 33</span>But
some will say, &lsquo;Ah, but in religious matters Popery is
making progress, for it is winning so many perverts to its
errors.&rsquo;&nbsp; I know there are perverts, and I am deeply
grieved at it, but I doubt whether Rome&rsquo;s progress is as
great as many think.&nbsp; It has been calculated that in the
year 1801 there were in Great Britain and Ireland twenty-seven
Romanists out of every hundred of the population, but that in
1869 there were only eighteen.&nbsp; The proportion, therefore,
had actually diminished from twenty-seven to eighteen per
cent.</p>
<p>But take a wider range, and look at the great facts of
European history.&nbsp; At the Lateran Council in 1513, after all
the so-called heretics had been silenced <a
name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 34</span>or burned, it
was proclaimed, &lsquo;No one now opposes, no one now
objects,&rsquo; and then the orator addressing the Pope said,
&lsquo;The whole body of Christendom is now subjugated to one
head, even to thee.&rsquo;&nbsp; But it is calculated that there
are now more than 95,000,000 Protestants in Europe, and
67,000,000 members of the Greek Church, making together
162,000,000 who reject the Pope&rsquo;s authority, against
157,000,000 who profess to submit to it.&nbsp; Putting all these
facts together, I may ask any reasonable man, any one who looks
at great facts instead of minute details, Is there not reason to
believe that the consumption has begun?&nbsp; What else is it
that has taken away his dominions, broken up his concordats,
overturned his throne, stripped him of his property, and above
all has set 95,000,000 in Europe alone free from his yoke?&nbsp;
<a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>What else
is it but the fulfilment of the prophecy, &lsquo;Whom the Lord
shall consume with the Spirit of His mouth,&rsquo; preparatory to
the time when He shall &lsquo;destroy him with the brightness of
His coming?&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now there are many lessons that we might learn if we had but
time from this subject; <i>e.g.</i> I might well spend all the
time that remains in pressing on you the importance of keeping
clear of all alliance with Rome.&nbsp; If God is consuming her,
God&rsquo;s people must have nothing to do with her either in
politics or religion, for if they do, they will find themselves
drawn into the vortex into which she must infallibly sink.&nbsp;
The message to them is, &lsquo;Come out of her, my people, that
ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her
plagues.&rsquo;</p>
<p>But this is not my point in this lecture.&nbsp; I am anxious
rather that we should look <a name="page36"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 36</span>on the whole subject as an
encouragement to faith.&nbsp; Surely some amongst us are too
fainthearted about the truth.&nbsp; It really seems as if they
could trust the Lord Jesus for their own souls, but not for His
church, or for His truth: as if they had forgotten the text,
&lsquo;Are not thine eyes upon the truth?&rsquo;&nbsp; They value
their Bible, and are ready to contend for it even unto the death;
but still, they do not above half believe it.&nbsp; They are
ready to go forth to battle, but they are not ready to begin,
like Jehoshaphat, with the hymn, &lsquo;Praise the
Lord!&rsquo;&nbsp; They would rather chant some plaintive lament,
and go into the battle with the doleful expectation of
defeat.&nbsp; But this is not faith.&nbsp; This is not trust in
the Lord Jesus.&nbsp; Ah! but one says he cannot rely on
government, and another that he does not trust in bishops.&nbsp;
But what has this <a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>to do with it?&nbsp; No one asks you to trust in rulers
either in Church or State, for the Scripture says, &lsquo;Put not
your trust in princes.&rsquo;&nbsp; What we ask you to do is to
trust the Lord Jesus Christ at the right hand of God.&nbsp; Trust
Him, and all will be right, though all other objects of trust
fail you.</p>
<p>Now take this great subject as a help to your trust.&nbsp; See
how it exhibits Him in His own time, and His own way, working out
His own predicted purpose.&nbsp; It was utterly impossible for
any man by private interpretation to calculate the course that
things would take.&nbsp; But He foresaw all, and more than two
thousand years ago He actually foretold what He would do.&nbsp;
And now, after all these centuries have passed, after great
empires have risen and fallen according to His prophecy, after
every species of effort <a name="page38"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 38</span>has been made in vain to silence
God&rsquo;s Word, after every available means have been
employed,&mdash;political influence, religious influence,
priestly assumption, and fiery persecution&mdash;to stamp out
God&rsquo;s truth, we see the Lord Jesus with a mighty hand
fulfilling His word, carrying out His purpose, and preparing the
way for victory.&nbsp; And is that the time to distrust
Him?&nbsp; If we are so fainthearted now what should we have been
before the Reformation?&nbsp; What should we have been after John
Huss was burned, and when the Lord&rsquo;s own people were like
the seven thousand hidden ones in the days of Elijah?&nbsp; If we
cannot trust Him now, that we have experienced that &lsquo;His
counsels of old are faithfulness and truth,&rsquo; what should we
have done if we had lived before any prophecies had been
fulfilled; if we had had to trust to His <a
name="page39"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 39</span>bare naked
word before it was confirmed by history?&nbsp; But now that we
have this great confirmation, and now that we see the putting
forth of His hand, this is not the time for faintheartedness or
misgiving; this is not the time to distrust Him whom God has made
the &lsquo;head over all things to His Church.&rsquo;&nbsp; It is
true that</p>
<blockquote><p>&lsquo;God moves in a mysterious way<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His wonders to perform;&rsquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>but it is certain that He is riding on the storm and will
perform His own wonders, so that we may add, as in the next verse
of the same hymn,</p>
<p class="poetry">&lsquo;Ye fearful saints, fresh courage
take,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The cloud ye so much dread<br />
Is big with mercies, and will break<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In blessings on your head.&rsquo;</p>
<p>And not only so, but we may reverently hope that it will not
be long before we <a name="page40"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
40</span>behold His triumph.&nbsp; When the disciples were on the
lake the night was dark, and the winds were contrary, but He came
to them in His own good time, and all was rest.&nbsp; So we may
meet with rough weather, but there will be a great calm when He
comes, and I cannot but hope He will soon be here.&nbsp; We have
long since known of Him on the mountain-top, but now we can
almost see Him walking on the waves.&nbsp; It is high time
therefore that we act on His own words, &lsquo;When these things
begin to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your heads, for
your redemption draweth nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; He does not say,
&lsquo;Wait till they have all come to pass,&rsquo; but
&lsquo;look up as soon as they begin.&rsquo;&nbsp; Now they most
undoubtedly have begun, and for a long time have been in
progress.&nbsp; It is high time therefore that we begin to look
up in faith and hope, waiting for <a name="page41"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 41</span>Christ, looking for Christ, longing
for Christ, and meanwhile trusting in Christ, so that when He
comes we may be found pardoned through His blood, accepted in His
covenant, clothed in His righteousness, and with loving hearts
waiting for His appearing.</p>

42</span>TURKEY.</h2>
<h3>III.<br />
THE EUPHRATES.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> condition of the Turkish Empire
is one of the greatest interests of the day, and is engaging more
than any other public subject the grave thoughts of thinking
men.&nbsp; The capitalists of England are deploring the loss of
not less than 50,000,000<i>l.</i> through its bankruptcy.&nbsp;
Those who rejoice in religious liberty are watching with the
deepest interest the noble struggles of the men of Herzegovina to
free themselves from the fearful yoke of Mahommedan
oppression.&nbsp; And the politicians of all the great states of
Europe are at their wits&rsquo; end to know what is to become of
<a name="page43"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
43</span>Turkey.&nbsp; Nor is this a state of things that has
come on suddenly.&nbsp; It is not the transitory effect of any
sudden calamity, but the result of a steady decay that has been
going forward with irresistible power for certainly not less than
fifty years.&nbsp; France and England combined in the Crimean war
to endeavour to maintain the Turkish power, but it was all in
vain.&nbsp; That power has been steadily on the wane ever since,
till now the crisis of bankruptcy has arrived, and &lsquo;the
Sick Man,&rsquo; as the Turkish empire has been called, appears
on the very point of his dissolution.</p>
<p>Now I am quite aware of the difficulty of preaching on such
subjects, and I have no doubt that in your mind as well as my own
there is a preference for those portions of the Word of God which
bear directly on our spiritual experience; <a
name="page44"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 44</span>but still
&lsquo;all Scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is
profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for
instruction in righteousness;&rsquo; and, moreover, there is a
special blessing on the congregational study of this Revelation
of St. John, for it is said, chap. i. 3, &lsquo;Blessed is he
that readeth, and they that hear the words of this
prophecy.&rsquo;&nbsp; I propose, therefore, to consider three
questions: (1.) Has the present state of Turkey been foretold in
prophecy?&nbsp; (2.) Does it teach us any lessons respecting our
spiritual position?&nbsp; (3.) Does it throw any light on our
hope of the coming of our Lord?&nbsp; I pray God that He may
fulfil to us the promise attached to this wonderful book, and
that both they that hear and he that readeth may alike enjoy His
blessing.</p>
<p>With reference to the first question,&mdash;<a
name="page45"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 45</span>Has the
present state of Turkey been foretold in prophecy?&nbsp; I have
not the least hesitation in expressing my own conviction that it
has been foretold in a most remarkable manner, and that the
present state of things is nothing more than the fulfilment of
what God predicted little less than 1800 years ago.</p>
<p>It is impossible in a short lecture to give all the reasons
for this opinion.&nbsp; I can only attempt the barest
outline.&nbsp; But we may gain some idea of the subject if we
consider what is meant by the Euphrates; what by its overflow;
and what by its drying up, in the words of Scripture, as
contained in Rev. xvi. 12: &lsquo;And the sixth angel poured out
his vial upon the great river Euphrates, and the waters thereof
were dried up.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The Euphrates.&nbsp; By this we must not understand
the literal river, for the <a name="page46"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 46</span>whole book is symbolical.&nbsp; The
river, therefore, stands as the symbol for something else.&nbsp;
It is this that makes the subject so difficult, for the symbols
are like hieroglyphics, and therefore, though full of meaning,
peculiarly liable to be misunderstood.&nbsp; The question then
is, what is the power of which the Euphrates in this verse stands
as a symbol, or hieroglyphic?&nbsp; Of course, in the answer to
such a question, we must distrust ourselves, and I dare not speak
on it with the certainty with which we ought to speak of the
plainly revealed facts of Scripture.&nbsp; All I can do is to
express my own very confident conviction that by the Euphrates is
symbolized the Ottoman, or, as it is frequently called, the
Turkish Empire.</p>
<p>For this I give two reasons:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; It is the one great empire existing <a
name="page47"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 47</span>in the world
that originated on the banks of the river Euphrates.&nbsp; Its
birthplace was at Bagdad, and it would be historically more
correct to call it the Euphratian than the Turkish Empire.&nbsp;
For we must remember that the Turks, or Ottomans, do not belong
to the soil.&nbsp; The French are the natives of France, and the
Italians of Italy, but the Turks are not the natives of Turkey,
but invaders from Asia.&nbsp; They hold the country by
conquest.&nbsp; The head-quarters of the empire are now in
Turkey, on the shores of the Bosphorus; but its birthplace was
Bagdad, on the banks of the Euphrates.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; There are two series of prophecies in the book of
Revelation, the one given under the figure of seven trumpets, the
other of seven vials, and they appear to be linked together by a
very remarkable connexion as to the subject of the
prophecies.&nbsp; <a name="page48"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
48</span>You will see the correspondence clearly if you compare
the account of the trumpets in chapters viii. and ix. with that
of the vials in chapter xvi.</p>
<p>When the first trumpet sounded the judgment was on the earth,
viii. 7; and so the first vial was poured on the earth, xvi.
2.</p>
<p>When the second trumpet sounded the judgment was on the sea,
chap, viii. 8.&nbsp; So the second vial was poured on the sea,
xvi. 3.</p>
<p>When the third trumpet sounded, the judgment was on the rivers
and fountains of waters, viii. 10.&nbsp; So the third angel
poured out his vial on the rivers and fountains of waters, xvi.
4.</p>
<p>When the fourth trumpet sounded, the judgment was on the sun,
viii. 12.&nbsp; So the fourth angel poured out his vial on the
sun, xvi. 8.</p>
<p><a name="page49"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 49</span>When
the fifth trumpet sounded, the judgment was on those men who had
not the seal of God on their foreheads, ix. 4.&nbsp; So the fifth
vial was on the seat of the beast, xvi. 10.</p>
<p>The correspondence is not at first sight so apparent in this
as in the other vials; but if we bear in mind the prophecy that
all shall worship the beast whose names are not written in the
book of life, we shall see the same reality in the
coincidence.</p>
<p>And, lastly, when the sixth trumpet sounded, there was a
mighty host loosed from the Euphrates, ix. 14; and when the sixth
vial was poured out, it fell on the Euphrates, and the Euphrates
was dried up, xvi. 12.</p>
<p>Surely, then, we may come to the conclusion that this prophecy
in chapter <a name="page50"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
50</span>xvi. relates to the same great power as that referred to
in chapter ix.; and as I believe that it has been proved that the
trumpet prophecy predicts the invasion of Christendom by the
Ottoman empire, so I am persuaded in my own mind that that under
the vial foretells its exhaustion and decay.&nbsp; The Ottoman
empire I believe to be the subject of both the prophecies.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; The overflow.&nbsp; There is no actual mention of
the symbol of an overflow, but as that figure is employed in Holy
Scripture to represent invasion, we may use it in this instance
as descriptive of the invasion by the Ottomans, as predicted
under the seventh trumpet.&nbsp; If you turn to Jer. xlvi. 7, 8,
you find an invasion by Egypt described by an exactly similar
figure.&nbsp; The invasion by Egypt is there compared to an
overflow <a name="page51"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
51</span>of the Nile.&nbsp; &lsquo;Egypt cometh up like a flood,
and his waters are moved as the rivers.&rsquo;&nbsp; So in
Isaiah, viii. 7, 8, the invasion of Palestine by the Assyrians is
foretold under the figure of an inundation: &lsquo;He shall come
up over all his channels, and go over all his banks: and he shall
pass through Judah; he shall overflow, and go over.&rsquo;&nbsp;
And so here the invasion by the Ottoman or Euphratian horsemen
appears to be represented by an overflow of the Euphrates.</p>
<p>Now consider the result of the recent floods in our own
country.&nbsp; When the Trent rose above its banks, what
happened?&nbsp; The waters spread far and wide on both sides the
river, till, instead of fields and homesteads, you saw a vast
inland lake.&nbsp; As you passed by in the train you might have
seen the whole country under water.&nbsp; Just so it was <a
name="page52"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 52</span>when,
according to the symbol, the Euphrates overflowed its banks; or,
according to history, the Ottomans invaded Europe.&nbsp; The
invading waters rushed on in every direction.&nbsp; On the east
they reached the borders of China; on the west they soon reached
Palestine, and all the heroic efforts of the Crusaders failed to
check them.&nbsp; They then spread out in two branches.&nbsp; On
the south they crossed into Africa, and spread over the whole
northern portion of that vast continent.&nbsp; In the north they
spread rapidly over Asia Minor, crossed the Bosphorus, conquered
Greece, and spread over Europe till they reached the shores of
the Adriatic, and even Venice.&nbsp; Thus when they had reached
the height of their power, the whole of south-east Europe, the
whole of north Africa, and the whole <a name="page53"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 53</span>of west Asia, were flooded by the
vast inundation.&nbsp; Their dominion extended from the shores of
the Adriatic on the west to the borders of China on the east;
while in Africa it reached from the Atlantic to Suez.&nbsp;
Accordingly we have been taught from our childhood of Turkey in
Europe, Turkey in Asia, and Turkey in Africa.&nbsp; But I am not
sure that we are all aware that the Turks, or Ottomans, are
Asiatic invaders who obtained their dominions by conquest.</p>
<p>III.&nbsp; So much for the overflow.&nbsp; Let us now turn to
the drying up as predicted in the prophecy.</p>
<p>Think once more of the illustration of the river, and consider
what would be the effect on the overflow if the waters were to
subside in the river.&nbsp; The inundation would gradually
recede, and one field after another would be left dry, until
after <a name="page54"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 54</span>a
time the whole country would be free.&nbsp; If, therefore, the
interpretation of the prophecy be correct, we should expect to
see the Ottoman power gradually dying out, and the various
nations that were overrun by conquest one by one shaking off the
yoke.&nbsp; And this is exactly what has been taking place ever
since the year 1820.&nbsp; There is a remarkable prophecy in
Daniel believed to refer to this same Ottoman power, and from it
some of the best students of prophecy in the course of the last
century named that year as the probable commencement of the
decline of Turkey.&nbsp; Up to the spring of the year all
appeared to prosper; but then the waters began rapidly to
recede.&nbsp; That very year the Greek insurrection began.&nbsp;
The flood receded from Greece, so that in 1827 the present
kingdom was established.&nbsp; In that same year the inundation
<a name="page55"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 55</span>went back
so far that Servia was left dry.&nbsp; In the same year Moldavia
and Wallachia, and the territory north of the Danube, were set
free from the Ottoman yoke; and now there seems to be every hope
that Herzegovina and Bosnia will succeed in shaking off the
invader.&nbsp; Indeed, the whole Turkish Empire is in such a
condition that if the statesmen of Europe could agree as to who
should possess Constantinople, the whole Ottoman Power would in
all probability be driven out of Europe before another year is
over.</p>
<p>As for Africa, the flood has already left it almost dry.&nbsp;
Morocco has become an independent state.&nbsp; The French have
taken Algeria, while on the east, Egypt has asserted its
independence, and with the one exception of an annual tribute, is
entirely free from the Turkish yoke.&nbsp; <a
name="page56"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 56</span>For some
years this process had been going on, till at length, in 1866,
the Pasha assumed the title of &lsquo;Khedive,&rsquo; which means
king, proclaiming thereby an independent monarchy.&nbsp; The only
possession remaining to Turkey is the little province of Tripoli,
containing considerably less than 1,000,000 inhabitants.&nbsp;
Turkey in Africa has almost ceased to exist.&nbsp; Turkey in
Europe may last a little longer, but is going fast.&nbsp; As for
Turkey in Asia, it has ceased to be a power to any distance east
of the Euphrates; and I fully believe that on the west of the
river the drying-up process will be steadily continued till the
floods recede from Palestine, and that beautiful land is set free
from the blight of Turkish misgovernment, and handed over to be
once more a land flowing with milk and honey to its rightful
possessors, the seed <a name="page57"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 57</span>of Abraham, the nation to which God
has given it.</p>
<p>Such are a few of the leading events with reference to the
decline of the Ottoman empire; and there is only one further
remark that I would make respecting it.&nbsp; The failure has not
been the result of external conquest, but of internal
decay.&nbsp; The Turks have not been brought down by any great
defeats, but by their own want of life.&nbsp; The powers of
Europe have not attacked them, but, on the contrary, have done
their best to uphold them, as, <i>e.g.</i>, in the Crimean war;
but, notwithstanding all that France and England could do, their
power is falling to pieces of itself.&nbsp; The sick man is
dying, and the physicians cannot keep him alive.&nbsp; Their
energy seems gone, their exchequer is exhausted, and their
population is so <a name="page58"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
58</span>much diminished, that there are now only 2,000,000 Turks
or Ottomans left in Europe.&nbsp; In other words, the Euphrates
is drying up, and the inundation cannot long remain upon the
land.</p>
<p>Now I can quite understand the feeling of those who have
experienced a certain amount of disappointment in hearing this
morning about the Turkish empire, instead of something bearing
more directly on their own personal salvation, and I should
myself have preferred to have preached on some such
subject.&nbsp; But I have taken this subject on principle.</p>
<p>1.&nbsp; Because, as I have already said, &lsquo;all Scripture
is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine,
for reproof, for correction, for instruction in
righteousness.&rsquo;&nbsp; No portion, therefore, of God&rsquo;s
word, whether it be prophetic or historical, ought to be set
aside by <a name="page59"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
59</span>those who really desire to know God&rsquo;s truth.&nbsp;
If we wish to know the whole mind of God we must be prepared to
study the whole of the Holy Scriptures which God has given
us.</p>
<p>2.&nbsp; But, besides that, we must remember that our whole
faith depends on Holy Scripture.&nbsp; All that we know of the
Lord Jesus Christ, of His great high priesthood, of His atoning
blood, of His free salvation, of the gift of the Holy Ghost, of
the new birth, and of the coming advent, all our hope for the
future, and all our rest for the present, depend simply and
entirely on the word of God.&nbsp; In it we find all; without it
we have nothing.&nbsp; When, therefore, we see a great prophecy
of Holy Scripture fulfilled in our own day, within reach of our
own observation, traceable on our own maps, and included within
the range of our own memory, we ought <a name="page60"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 60</span>not to pass it by, but should accept
it with thankfulness in these days of rebuke and infidelity, as a
most blessed confirmation of our faith.&nbsp; Let any one who has
a different view respecting Scripture look at the facts.&nbsp;
Two thousand four hundred years ago there was a prophet, the
prophet Daniel, by the river of Ulai, and he foresaw in a vision
the rise and progress of a mighty power, telling us at the same
time how long it was likely to continue.&nbsp; Six hundred years
after him there arose another prophet, who described what appears
to be the same power, and gave a graphic picture both of its
progress and decay.&nbsp; Students of Holy Scripture have since
been diligently occupied in the study of these two prophecies;
and by comparing Scripture with Scripture were long since brought
to the conclusion that in the course of this century the decline
<a name="page61"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 61</span>of the
Ottoman Empire would take place.&nbsp; And now we see it going
on.&nbsp; Just when the students thought it would begin, then it
began, and just as the prophet described its decay, so it is
decaying.&nbsp; The prophets themselves could have known nothing
about it when they prophesied, for the empire did not arise till
many centuries after they had foretold its fall.&nbsp; But God
knew all, and a thousand years were to Him as one day.&nbsp;
These prophecies, therefore, did not arise from any private
interpretation or human calculation of probabilities, but
&lsquo;holy men of God spake as they were moved by the Holy
Ghost.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Now what should be the result on our minds?&nbsp; What effect
should such facts have on ourselves?&nbsp; Should they not
strengthen faith and confirm us in a simple, childlike,
unquestioning trust in the inspired word of the living God?&nbsp;
<a name="page62"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 62</span>Who but
God Himself could have foretold either to Daniel or John the rise
and decay of the Ottoman Empire?&nbsp; It is God&rsquo;s own
word, then, with which we are dealing when we study Holy
Scripture.&nbsp; There may be things in it completely beyond all
power of human calculation, as the history of the Ottoman Empire
was utterly beyond the human calculation of either Daniel or
John.&nbsp; But God&rsquo;s truth does not depend on our power of
calculation.&nbsp; It is beyond us altogether, infinite, eternal,
divine; and our part is, whether we can fit it together or not,
to receive the whole as God has given it, and as weak, ignorant,
short-lived, and short-sighted creatures, to receive His will as
He has revealed it, into our hands, and hearts, and say, &lsquo;I
believe God, that it shall be as it was said unto me.&rsquo;</p>

THE FROGS.</h3>
<p><span class="smcap">In</span> opening our subject in the last
lecture, I said that there were three questions to be considered:
1.&nbsp; Has the present state of Turkey been foretold in
prophecy?&nbsp; 2.&nbsp; Does it teach us any lessons respecting
our spiritual position? and 3.&nbsp; Does it throw any light on
the blessed hope of our Lord&rsquo;s return?&nbsp; The first of
these questions we examined in the last lecture, and surely it
was proved that in the symbol of the drying up of the Euphrates
we have a most remarkable symbolic prophecy of the exhaustion of
the Ottoman power.&nbsp; To-day we are to pass on to the second
question: Is our own spiritual position affected by the
exhaustion <a name="page64"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
64</span>of Turkish power?&nbsp; Now I can quite understand the
thought that has no doubt occurred to many of you, that the two
things can have no possible connexion with each other, for there
seems to our mind to be no possible connexion of even the most
remote character between the Turkish Empire and our own spiritual
life.&nbsp; We may well say, &lsquo;What have we to do with the
Turks, or the Turks with us in our own daily, private walk with
God?&rsquo;&nbsp; It may surprise some of you when I say that,
although no man can explain the reason of the connexion, I
believe it to be very intimate, and that the religious life of
modern Christendom is in a most remarkable manner bound up with
the decline of the Turkish Empire.</p>
<p>To understand this we must remember that the great prophecy in
the book of <a name="page65"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
65</span>Revelation is arranged in periods.&nbsp; Each seal, each
trumpet, and each vial, represents a period.&nbsp; So there is
one particular period of history foretold under the figure of the
sixth vial, and all the events predicted under that vial we
should expect to appear at about the same time in history.&nbsp;
Whether we can trace any connexion or not, the events of each
vial are linked together in respect of time; so that if there are
two events under any one vial, when we see the one we ought to
look out for the other, and when one takes place we have every
reason to believe that the other is at hand.&nbsp; Now there are
two events, apparently quite distinct in themselves, which are
thus connected with each other under the sixth vial&mdash;the
drying up of the Euphrates, and the appearance of certain most
dangerous and seductive <a name="page66"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 66</span>spirits, going forth to gather men
together for the battle of Almighty God.&nbsp; If, therefore, it
be a fact, as I firmly believe it to be a fact, that the
Euphrates is now being dried up, then it follows as a sure and
certain consequence that the unclean spirits are soon, if not
already, going forth to do their deadly work.&nbsp; The two
things go on according to the prophecy within the same prophetic
period, and therefore if we see the one, as believers in the word
of God, we ought to be on the look-out for the other.&nbsp; We
are thus brought to the conclusion, that whenever the Euphrates
shall be drying up, there will be a time of great spiritual
seduction; or, in other words, that the exhaustion of the Turkish
Empire will be accompanied, or quickly followed, by a remarkable
development of mischievous spiritual power.&nbsp; This, <a
name="page67"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 67</span>then, must be
our subject in this lecture, and we will study (if God permit)
first the danger, and then the caution.&nbsp; May God grant that
the result may be that we may be like those few men of Sardis who
had not defiled their garments, and who will walk with the Lord
Jesus in white, for they are worthy!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; The danger.</p>
<p>This is described in verses 13, 14.&nbsp; &lsquo;And I saw
three unclean spirits like frogs come out of the mouth of the
dragon, and out of the mouth of the beast, and out of the mouth
of the false prophet.&nbsp; For they are the spirits of devils
working miracles, which go forth unto the kings of the earth and
of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the great day
of God Almighty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>All students of prophecy are well <a name="page68"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 68</span>aware how much has been written in
exposition of these two verses, and what different explanations
have been given of these three seductive spirits.&nbsp; I have
not time this morning to discuss any of them, but there are three
things perfectly clear, and it will be sufficient for us to study
them.</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The subtlety of the danger.</p>
<p>The passage does not describe three empires, or three
churches, or three great societies, or three organizations of any
kind whatever, but three spirits.&nbsp; Now a spirit is something
subtle and unseen.&nbsp; Its presence is not perceived; its voice
is not heard; its touch is not felt.&nbsp; It comes and goes, but
it leaves no footsteps in the sand.&nbsp; It seems, therefore, a
great mistake to explain this prophecy by different systems that
are conspicuous to the eye, and we must <a
name="page69"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 69</span>be careful
lest, by so doing, we should be thrown off our guard with
reference to our real danger.&nbsp; There may be no false system
presented to us, and we may be perfectly safe with reference to
any definite form of evil, such as infidelity or popery, but
there may be any one, or indeed all three, of these deadly
spirits imperceptibly breathing poison into our souls.&nbsp; It
is this subtlety of spiritual action that makes it so
pre-eminently dangerous.&nbsp; If it were all open and before the
eye we should know how to avoid it.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; The variety.</p>
<p>There is not one spirit only, but there are three acting
together.&nbsp; We are taught, therefore, that at the time of the
drying up of the Euphrates we must be prepared for subtle and
seductive power of various forms and characters.&nbsp; If there
were only <a name="page70"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
70</span>one spirit the danger might assume only one form: but as
there are three spirits acting together we should be on our guard
against every possible combination.&nbsp; We are not merely to
look out for three distinct and separate forms of error, but, as
all the three act together, they may combine in every conceivable
variety.&nbsp; One may act on one mind, two on another, and all
three on a third, and so produce the most remarkable and
inconsistent combinations.&nbsp; Suppose, <i>e.g.</i>, that the
first was Infidelity, the second Worldliness, and the third
Popery.&nbsp; Remember, I do not say that they are, but suppose
they were.&nbsp; In some cases you might have avowed Atheism; in
some, a life so absorbed in the world that a man does not even
take the trouble to be an infidel; and in others pure and
unadulterated Romanism.&nbsp; But, besides <a
name="page71"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 71</span>that, you
might find every possible combination.&nbsp; Sceptical opinions
might be combined with Romish ritual, and high ceremonial with
worldliness of life.&nbsp; Indeed, there is scarcely any form of
seductive error that you might not develope by combining in
different proportions those three most dangerous spirits.&nbsp;
Thus it follows that, though a person may be well on his guard
against one, he may be gradually entangled by the other two; and
though he may be on the watch against all in their distinct and
separate forms, he may be drawn out of a straight path by a
beautiful combination of the three, in which, according to St.
Paul&rsquo;s illustration, Satan has transformed himself into an
angel of light.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; The result of the action of these spirits in
conflict.&nbsp; Verse 14,&mdash;&lsquo;For they are the spirits
of devils working miracles, <a name="page72"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 72</span>which go forth unto the kings of the
earth and of the whole world, to gather them to the battle of the
great day of God Almighty.&rsquo;</p>
<p>Their special object appears to be to gather together the
kings to the battle of the great day of God Almighty; and in
studying the prophecy it is impossible to forget the political
difficulties that have already arisen from the decline of
Turkey.&nbsp; But we must not limit the prophecy to kings, for
the warning voice of verse 15 clearly applies to us all.&nbsp;
Kings are not the only persons who find it necessary to watch and
keep their garments.&nbsp; These spirits, then, are predicted as
gathering men together for battle.&nbsp; When they are abroad
truth and error will be thrown into antagonism.&nbsp; The Lord
Jesus Christ will be collecting His forces, and Satan his: there
will be <a name="page73"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 73</span>on
both sides the mustering of the host.&nbsp; Those that are on the
side of the Lamb will rally round His banner, &lsquo;called, and
chosen, and faithful;&rsquo; and those that are under the
influence of any of the seductive spirits will throw themselves
into the ranks of open opposition.&nbsp; The characteristic of
the day will be, not sloth or indifference, but zeal, eagerness,
and conflict.</p>
<p>Now no one can have watched the progress of men&rsquo;s minds
during the last half century without observing that this has been
most remarkably the case.&nbsp; There cannot be a doubt as to the
fact that, while the Turkish power has been declining, the powers
of good and evil throughout Christendom have been awakening into
life.&nbsp; The two processes have gone on side by side.&nbsp;
Turkey has been drying up, and almost every state <a
name="page74"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 74</span>in Europe has
been aroused to religious conflict.&nbsp; Many amongst us have
been able to trace the vast change that has taken place during
our own lifetimes.&nbsp; I can see myself an immense difference
between the state of things when I commenced my ministry forty
years ago, and the state of things now.&nbsp; Then the
characteristic of the day was stagnation, but now it is
conflict.&nbsp; Then our warfare was against cold, dull, dead,
stolid indifference; but now error in every shape is in full
activity, and we require to be armed at all points against every
species of attack.&nbsp; Then all that unconverted men desired
was to be left undisturbed in the deep sleep that had settled
down on their souls.&nbsp; But they are all awake now, and the
cry is &lsquo;To arms!&rsquo;&nbsp; Many, alas! are on the wrong
side.&nbsp; Far too many have fallen under the fatal influence <a
name="page75"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 75</span>of these
seducing spirits; but, whether on the wrong side or the right,
they are awake.&nbsp; They are up, and hurrying to their
post.&nbsp; The time for sleep is over; the bugle has sounded,
the ranks are forming, the struggle has begun, and the time is
come when those who know their Saviour must be prepared to stand
with a holy decision on His side.</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; And now you can see the overwhelming importance of
the warning of this verse: &lsquo;Blessed is he that watcheth and
keepeth his garments, lest he walk naked, and they see his
shame.&rsquo;&nbsp; You can see that the exhaustion of Turkey is
a conspicuous signal from God to arouse all Christendom to
watchfulness.&nbsp; We cannot see the three unclean spirits
coming forth, but we can see Turkey decaying; and that is
God&rsquo;s visible <a name="page76"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
76</span>signal that the invisible spirits are at work.&nbsp; If
ever, therefore, there was a time for especial watchfulness it is
now.&nbsp; If ever there was a time when our young people require
to be cautioned, and warned, and helped, and guided, it is
now.&nbsp; And you will observe that the warning is given to
those who have some garments.&nbsp; It is not spoken to the
heathen, or unconverted worldlings; but to those who have, what I
may term, some sort of Christian clothing.&nbsp; I have not time
to discuss what that clothing is.&nbsp; It may be their baptismal
robe, that which they put on when they were baptized into
Christ.&nbsp; It may be the robe of their Christian profession,
that which they wear habitually in daily life; or it may even be
that spotless robe washed white in the blood of the Lamb, in
which alone they can stand before God, the <a
name="page77"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 77</span>wedding
garment of the perfect righteousness of the Lord Jesus
Christ.&nbsp; In whatever sense we understand the expression, the
solemn and sacred warning from God to every one of us, both old
and young, is the same; viz. that we watch and keep our garments,
lest we walk naked, and they see our shame.&nbsp; We see the
Euphrates drying up, and therefore we know that the evil spirits
are abroad.&nbsp; We know, <i>i.e.</i> that there are subtle,
deadly influences all around us, of various kinds and characters,
whose object is to draw us away from the simplicity that is in
Christ, to strip us of our garments, and to enlist us on the
wrong side of the struggle.&nbsp; We may not be aware of their
stealthy approach; and we are not likely to be so, for we are
certain not to see them.&nbsp; We need not necessarily be shocked
by their suggestions, <a name="page78"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 78</span>for, though they be unclean spirits,
they can clothe their temptation in the form of beauty.&nbsp;
But, whether we detect them or not, we may be sure they are at
work, and in full activity.&nbsp; They are moving with stealthy
steps in the midst of us.&nbsp; They are approaching our minds in
secret, disturbing prayer, suggesting doubts, weakening faith,
poisoning thought, alienating love, and so labouring by subtle,
mental influence, to detach us from Christ.&nbsp; And only think
what the result would be if they were to succeed; nothing less
than this, that we should walk naked and they would see our
shame.&nbsp; It is not clear who is meant by the
&lsquo;they&rsquo; that are to see the shame.&nbsp; It may be the
world at large, or it may be the very spirits that have done the
mischief, looking on with a fiendish smile on the misery and
nakedness of <a name="page79"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
79</span>the poor wretch whom they have ruined.&nbsp; But it
matters not who sees it; that will make very little
difference.&nbsp; To be naked before God, that is enough.&nbsp;
He is sure to see it, and the dreadful horrors of such a position
far exceed any power of human imagination.&nbsp; You remember how
St. Paul spoke of it in 2 Cor. v. 3: &lsquo;If so be that being
clothed&rsquo; (clothed, <i>i.e.</i> with the resurrection body)
&lsquo;we shall not be found naked.&rsquo;&nbsp; Clothed, but yet
naked.&nbsp; Risen, but not covered.&nbsp; Alive with all the
realities of the body, and all the faculties of the mind, memory,
and conscience; but with the poor soul naked, without a claim,
without an excuse, without an atonement, without a plea, without
a Saviour, without any hope for all eternity of either
concealment or forgiveness.&nbsp; The thought is too dreadful to
be borne.&nbsp; Oh, may God in mercy <a name="page80"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 80</span>grant that not one of us, and not one
whom we love, may be found naked in that day!&nbsp; And oh! what
an inexpressible joy it is for the child of God, however weak,
however unworthy, however unable to cope with all the seductions
of those wicked spirits, to fall back on the sure promise of his
blessed Saviour: &lsquo;They shall never perish, neither shall
any man pluck them out of My hand.&rsquo;&nbsp; He can keep us,
and we may be sure He will.&nbsp; Let us throw ourselves then
into His hand to be clothed, to be kept, to be watched over, to
be held fast, that so, preserved in Christ Jesus, and clothed in
His spotless robe, we may never be found naked, but may when He
comes be presented faultless before the presence of His glory
with exceeding joy.</p>
<h3><a name="page81"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 81</span>V.<br
/>
THE ADVENT.</h3>
<p>I <span class="smcap">trust</span> there are many amongst us
who are able to say, from the very depths of their longing
hearts, &lsquo;I wait for the Lord, my soul doth
wait.&rsquo;&nbsp; The long-expected coming of the Lord is the
blessed hope on which their hearts rest in eager and earnest
expectation, and they can add their unqualified
&lsquo;Amen&rsquo; to the last prayer of Scripture, &lsquo;Even
so, come, Lord Jesus.&rsquo;</p>
<p>I am persuaded that all those who are thus looking for the
coming of the Lord must feel the greatest possible interest in
the last of the three subjects proposed for our consideration
with reference to the exhaustion of the <a
name="page82"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 82</span>Turkish
Empire, as symbolized by the drying up of the Euphrates.&nbsp; We
have seen that the exhaustion which is now attracting the anxious
attention of all the politicians of Europe was foretold more than
eighteen hundred years ago in this remarkable symbolic
prophecy.&nbsp; We found also in the last lecture that the
internal decay of Turkey is a warning to us all to be on the
watch against the seductive spirits of the latter days; and we
now have to examine whether there is any connexion between that
decay and the glorious advent of the Lord Jesus; whether, in
other words, the decline of the Ottoman empire is not like the
cry which aroused the ten virgins in the parable, &lsquo;The
Bridegroom cometh.&rsquo;&nbsp; There are two questions which
will clearly require our careful study, (1.) What light does the
decline <a name="page83"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 83</span>of
the Ottoman Empire throw on the near approach of our Lord&rsquo;s
return?&nbsp; And (2), if it does throw such a light, how are we
to understand His declaration that He will come as a thief?&nbsp;
May God Himself, who has inspired His own word, be graciously
pleased to direct us in the study of it; and to lead us, every
one of us, to be perfectly ready, waiting for the Lord Jesus!</p>
<p>I.&nbsp; What light, then, does the decay of the Ottoman
Empire throw on the prospect of the near approach of our
Lord&rsquo;s return?&nbsp; Has it any bearing on our Christian
hope? and may we regard it as a signal from God that the time is
come when we may soon expect the Advent?</p>
<p>In order to answer this question we must examine:&mdash;</p>
<p>(1.)&nbsp; The position of the prophecy in the general
structure of the Book.&nbsp; The <a name="page84"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 84</span>prophecies of this wonderful book are
arranged on a divinely ordered plan.&nbsp; There are some
chapters to which it is difficult to assign their place; but it
is easy to see what may be termed the backbone running through
the whole.&nbsp; To use a very homely illustration, there is the
main line of rail conspicuously running through the whole, and
you may trace that clearly, though you cannot always trace the
branches.&nbsp; Now in this outline there are three great series
of prophetic periods&mdash;the seven seals, the seven trumpets,
and the seven vials; and these three series appear in a
remarkable manner to follow each other.&nbsp; First there are the
seals, as in chap. vi.; and when the sixth seal is opened, and
the seventh about to follow, there appears a general expectation
of the coming of the Lord.&nbsp; But when the seventh seal is
actually <a name="page85"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
85</span>opened, instead of our coming to the end, as apparently
was expected, we find a second series developed.&nbsp; The seven
trumpets were wrapped as it were in the seventh seal (viii. 1,
2), so that when it was opened they appeared, and a fresh series
commenced, and the trumpet-angels one after another blew their
blast.&nbsp; At length the seventh trumpet is sounded, and again
it appears as though you had reached the end.&nbsp; But like the
seventh seal, it, too, is found to contain within itself a third
series.&nbsp; The seven vials are wrapped within it, and when
that last trumpet is blown they are poured forth in awful
succession on a wicked world.&nbsp; Thus the seventh seal
contains all the trumpets, and the seventh trumpet all the
vials.&nbsp; Now if this be the case it is clear that the sixth
vial must come very near the end.&nbsp; The trumpets <a
name="page86"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 86</span>are none
sounded till the six seals are passed and the seventh seal is
opened.&nbsp; The vials do not begin till the six trumpets have
completed their blast and the seventh has sounded; and of the
vials five must have been poured out already, so that there can
be nothing remaining but the seventh, or the last.</p>
<p>To take the very homely illustration of a railway.&nbsp;
Suppose a series of stations on a line, the seventh being a
junction; suppose that on the branch from that junction there was
another series of stations, the seventh again being a junction;
and from that second junction there was another line of seven
stations, the last being your home.&nbsp; What would you think of
your position when you had travelled the whole length of the main
line, and the whole of the first branch, and when you had gone so
far along the second branch <a name="page87"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 87</span>that you had actually reached the
sixth station on that last line?&nbsp; You would say, surely,
that you were near the end of your journey, close to home.&nbsp;
Now whenever the Church of God reaches the sixth vial that will
be its position.&nbsp; All the seals will have been opened, all
the trumpets blown, and six of the seven vials poured out.</p>
<p>But that I believe to be our position now, and that we are at
this present time living under the sixth vial.&nbsp; I believe
that the great public, political event of the sixth vial, is the
drying up of the Ottoman Empire, and that we can all see to be in
progress.&nbsp; There can be no doubt about the great, public,
political fact.&nbsp; It is confirmed by every newspaper, and is
forced on the attention of England by the sore distress brought
on many families through the Turkish bankruptcy.&nbsp; But if
this be <a name="page88"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
88</span>the fact predicted by the symbol of the drying up of the
Euphrates, then it follows that we are living under the sixth
vial, and that the seventh vial is all that remains of the great
prophetic series.</p>
<p>(2.)&nbsp; But consider next the contents of the seventh
vial.&nbsp; The seventh seal contained the series of seven
trumpets, and the seventh trumpet the series of seven
vials.&nbsp; May there not be some similar series wrapped up in
the seventh vial?</p>
<p>Such a question would be perfectly reasonable, but the only
answer that we can give is that we do not find any such series
described in the prophecy.&nbsp; On the other hand, everything in
it looks like the end.&nbsp; When the seventh angel poured out
his vial there came a great voice out of the temple of heaven
from the throne, saying, &lsquo;It is done!&rsquo;&nbsp; It
certainly did not <a name="page89"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
89</span>look like the commencement of another series, but taught
us rather to look out for the great winding up of the world and
the final close of the great prophetic plan.&nbsp; So in the
account of the seventh vial you may see four things plainly
revealed.&nbsp; The fall of Babylon, which I believe to be the
fall of Rome: chap, xvi. 17, to the end of xviii.&nbsp; The
marriage supper of the Lamb, chap. xix. 1&ndash;9.&nbsp; The
triumphant victory of the Son of God: chap. xix. 11, 12; and,
last of all, the millennial reign, chap, xx.&nbsp; Surely, then,
this vial brings us to the end.&nbsp; Surely when it is poured
forth we shall have done with the politics of the world, and
shall cease to look for the gradual development of history.&nbsp;
All thoughts will then be occupied by the unspeakable blessedness
of the marriage supper of the Lamb.</p>
<p><a name="page90"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 90</span>It
seems clear, then, that the seventh vial is the close of the
series, and that under it we are to expect the final victory of
the Lord Jesus Christ.&nbsp; The conclusion, therefore, is plain,
that if the exhaustion of the Ottoman Empire is the event
symbolized by the drying up of the Euphrates, it is high time
that we awake out of sleep; for the sixth vial is already begun,
and we must soon expect to behold Christ Himself, with all the
joys of His kingdom and all the terrors of a crushing
victory.&nbsp; I say &lsquo;soon,&rsquo; not
&lsquo;immediately,&rsquo; for it does not appear that this
passage teaches us to expect it any day or hour, for it describes
certain great political events which have not yet taken
place.&nbsp; The Euphrates is drying, but not yet dry.&nbsp; The
kings have not yet passed over from the East, and the battle of
Almighty God, whatever <a name="page91"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 91</span>it may symbolize, has not yet been
fought.&nbsp; All, therefore, that we can say is, that we appear
to have reached what Daniel terms &lsquo;the time of the
end;&rsquo; that now it is high time to awake out of sleep, for
we already begin to see the first streaks of morning dawn.&nbsp;
We have already witnessed some of the great events that must very
shortly precede the Advent, and we may begin to look out full of
hope for the actual return of the Lord Himself.</p>
<p>(3.)&nbsp; This conclusion is confirmed by the words of our
Lord Himself.&nbsp; I need not stop to prove that He is the
speaker in this passage, but we must carefully observe His
words.&nbsp; What does He say when the sixth vial is poured out,
and the Euphrates is drying up, and when the three evil spirits
are gone forth through Christendom?&nbsp; What is the <a
name="page92"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 92</span>warning voice
which He Himself then gives out with reference to His
coming?&nbsp; What lesson would He have us learn from these great
events?&nbsp; Of what are they His signal?&nbsp; Does He not
teach us to be looking out for His coming?&nbsp; Does He not say,
&lsquo;Behold, I come as a thief?&rsquo;&nbsp; Does He not call
us to a double watchfulness, and teach us not merely to watch
against the seductive influence of these foul spirits, but to
watch also for His own appearing, and for the bright hope of
joyfully meeting Him?&nbsp; But if this be the case, and if the
prophecy of the sixth vial is really being now fulfilled, as we
believe it to be, by the drying up of the Turkish power; then
every fresh symptom of decay in that power, every loss of
territory by the Turks, every fresh insurrection, and every proof
that the empire is reduced to hopeless bankruptcy, <a
name="page93"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 93</span>is like a
clarion blast of the trumpet of God ringing through the ears of
Christendom; and proclaiming, with a distinctness which cannot be
mistaken, &lsquo;Watch, therefore, for ye know neither the day
nor the hour when the Son of Man cometh!&rsquo;</p>
<p>II.&nbsp; But if this be the case, it behoves us carefully to
examine our second question.&nbsp; If such a warning is so
clearly given, how can He be said to come as a thief?&nbsp; He
Himself teaches us perfectly clearly that the meaning of the
illustration is that, as the thief comes without giving notice,
so He will return without previously giving any such notice of
His approach as will arouse the sleepers.&nbsp; The thief does
not tell you when he is coming; and when he comes, he neither
knocks the door nor rings the bell.&nbsp; But he comes
quietly.&nbsp; He does <a name="page94"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 94</span>nothing to disturb those that are
asleep, and His object is to enter unobserved.&nbsp; So our Lord
teaches us, that when He comes He will do nothing to startle the
world.&nbsp; There will be nothing to prevent men eating and
drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, right up to the very
end.&nbsp; The men of the world will find Him in the house before
they have the least idea of His approach.&nbsp; That this is the
meaning of the words is perfectly clear from what He said (Matt.
xxiv. 42&ndash;44): &lsquo;Watch, therefore; for ye know not what
hour your Lord doth come.&nbsp; But know this, that if the
goodman of the house had known in what watch the thief would
come, he would have watched, and would not have suffered his
house to be broken up.&nbsp; Therefore be ye also ready: for in
such an hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.&rsquo;</p>
<p><a name="page95"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 95</span>But,
you may say, how far is this consistent with what has been said
of the probability of His return following quickly on the
exhaustion of the Ottoman Empire?&nbsp; If there be a prophetic
series in the book of Revelation, and we have already reached the
last station on the last branch of the line, how is it that He
can be said to come upon us without notice as a thief does?&nbsp;
Has He not given us notice in this prophecy?</p>
<p>In answer to that question we must observe the clearly marked
distinction between His own believing people and the unbelieving
world.&nbsp; To His own people He will not come as a thief, for
we read in 1 Thess. v. 4, 5, &lsquo;But ye, brethren, are not in
darkness that that day should overtake <i>you</i> as a
thief.&rsquo;&nbsp; <i>You</i> are in the light, <i>i.e.</i>, for
you can see Him coming; so <i>you</i> will not be found <a
name="page96"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 96</span>asleep.&nbsp;
So He Himself taught us distinctly in the very passage in which
He uses the illustration; for He there shows that His own
disciples are to expect His coming when they see the predicted
signs, just as they expect the summer when they see the budding
of the trees in spring. (Matt. xxiv. 32, 33.)&nbsp; Nor are they
to wait in their expectation till they see these signs fully
developed; not to wait, <i>i.e.</i>, till the young branch is
fully grown; but they are to watch beginnings, and learn from
them.&nbsp; They are to draw their conclusion when the branch is
yet tender, without waiting till it is fully ripened; as He
Himself taught us in Luke, xxi. 28: &lsquo;When these things
<i>begin</i> to come to pass, then look up, and lift up your
heads, for your redemption draweth nigh.&rsquo;&nbsp; If,
therefore, you be amongst the people of God, you need <a
name="page97"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 97</span>never be
taken by surprise.&nbsp; We do not know the exact time, but we
may study the predicted signs, and, having them before us, may
look out for the second advent just as Simeon and Anna looked out
for the first.&nbsp; We may be like the servant of Elijah, going
up again and again to the hill-top to watch for the coming rain;
or like the loving servant watching for the footsteps of the
master whom he loves, and perfectly ready, whenever he returns,
to open the door, and welcome him to his home.&nbsp; The Lord
came suddenly to His temple, but He did not come suddenly to
Simeon; and the Lord will come as a thief to the world, but if
you hold fast to His own word He will never be as a thief to
you.</p>
<p>As I have already said, it is the <i>world</i> that will be
found asleep, and to whom He will really come as a thief.&nbsp;
But some <a name="page98"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
98</span>man may say, &lsquo;If there be these signs beforehand,
will they not arouse the world as well as believers?&nbsp; Will
they not awaken society?&nbsp; Will they not compel men to
prepare?&rsquo;&nbsp; I answer that by another question, Do
they?&nbsp; There are certain signs already given; do they wake
up society?&nbsp; Have they produced such an impression as to
arouse the great mass of worldly men?&nbsp; There are the Jews
preserved as a separate people, in fulfilment of a prophecy given
more than three thousand years ago; what effect has such a
fulfilment of God&rsquo;s word had in the city?&nbsp; There are
all the politicians of Europe at their wits&rsquo; end because of
the decay of Turkey; how many even of yourselves have been led
thereby to look out for the near approach of our blessed
Saviour?&nbsp; There is Rome stripped of its <a
name="page99"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 99</span>temporal
power in fulfilment of great prophecies given, some of them, more
than two thousand years ago; how many are there that have been
led by that fulfilment to look out even for the fall of
Babylon?&nbsp; The simple fact is, that these great fulfilments,
though conspicuous to the eye of those who study them, completely
fail to produce the least impression on the deep sleep of the
unconverted world.&nbsp; The prophecies are not read; the facts
are not compared with them; the lessons are not learned; and the
soul is not aroused to preparation.&nbsp; How many are there even
in this very town on whom the fulfilment of God&rsquo;s prophetic
word has never produced the slightest effect?&nbsp; They are
living just as they would have lived, or rather sleeping as they
would have slept, if there had been no prophecy to give the
warning, <a name="page100"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
100</span>and no history to confirm its truth.&nbsp; Can you
wonder, then, that the Lord Jesus should come upon such persons
as a thief?</p>
<p>But I trust, dear brethren, that He may not come as a thief to
you, but that you may be found in the light and awake, not in
darkness and asleep; or, to use the illustration of this text,
that you may not wake up naked to your everlasting shame.&nbsp; I
am sure you desire when He comes to be found awake, looking out,
ready to welcome Him.&nbsp; You wish to be found clothed.&nbsp;
Oh, think what it would be to be found naked, when all the saints
of God are standing around you in their resurrection robe!&nbsp;
We have lately read of poor people startled in the night by
shipwreck, and rushing as they were to the deck, utterly
unprotected against the bitter blast of the winter&rsquo;s <a
name="page101"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
101</span>snow-storm.&nbsp; Think what it would be to be suddenly
aroused from your own deep sleep, to see all that you have in the
world wrecked around you, and to find your poor soul quite naked,
while the terrible storm of God&rsquo;s most just judgment beats
upon you, and breaks down every hope of escape!&nbsp; Oh, dear
brethren, may it never be so with you!&nbsp; May you be amongst
those who can peacefully look for His appearing, because you are
clothed in His righteousness!&nbsp; May you be kept walking in
the light, and cleansed from all sin through His most precious
blood!&nbsp; Then you will have nothing to fear, but everything
to hope for, in the thought of His coming.&nbsp; Then He will
never come as a thief to you, for you will be ready at any time
to open the door and welcome Him.&nbsp; As the bride delights in
the bridegroom, so <a name="page102"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
102</span>will you delight in Him.&nbsp; Your trial will consist,
not in the dread of His coming, but in the difficulty of
patiently waiting for His return; and when He comes you will find
no language to bless and praise His holy name, for His boundless
and unmerited love in having redeemed you by His atoning blood;
in having called you by His sovereign grace; in having forgiven
you through His finished atonement; in having sanctified you by
the Holy Ghost; and in having preserved you in His own unchanging
faithfulness, till He shall have finally presented you spotless
and faultless before the throne of His everlasting glory.</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
